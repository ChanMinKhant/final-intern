                        <h3><b><i>Infrastructure</i></b></h3>
                        <p>Start by ensuring sturdy housing that provides shelter from both the heat and monsoon rains
                            prevalent
                            in Myanmar. Good ventilation is crucial to prevent heat stress, and sturdy construction helps
                            withstand weather extremes. Adequate feeding areas and reliable water sources are essential for
                            maintaining cattle health throughout the year.</p>

                        <h3 style="color: #993300;"><b><i>Breeds Selection</i></b></h3>
                        <p>Choose cattle breeds that are well-suited to Myanmar's tropical climate and available pasture
                            resources. Consider local breeds or those adapted to similar environments for better resilience
                            against diseases and climate fluctuations. Balance your selection based on market preferences
                            for
                            beef or dairy production.</p>

                        <h3><b><i>Nutrition</i></b></h3>
                        <p>Focus on a balanced diet that includes locally available fodder and supplements. Myanmar's
                            diverse
                            agricultural landscape offers opportunities for pasture grazing and fodder cultivation,
                            supplemented
                            with rice straw or commercial feed as needed. Ensure cattle have access to clean water at all
                            times,
                            especially during the dry season.</p>

                        <h3><b><i>Healthcare</i></b></h3>
                        <p>Develop a proactive healthcare regimen that includes vaccinations against prevalent diseases like
                            foot-and-mouth disease and deworming treatments. Regular veterinary checks help catch health
                            issues
                            early, ensuring a healthier herd and reducing treatment costs over time.

                            Efficient waste management reduces environmental impact and enhances farm cleanliness. Train
                            staff
